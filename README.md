Todo-List
This project is a full-stack todo-list application that I created as practice for working on the backend. It was my first experience building the server-side, and it turned out to be quite exciting, though it required a significant amount of time and effort.

Project Description:
In this project, I developed the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and for the backend, I used Node.js. I chose MongoDB as the database and also used popular libraries and frameworks:

Express — for creating server logic;
bcryptjs — for securely handling passwords;
jsonwebtoken — for user authentication using JSON Web Tokens;
mongoose — for interacting with MongoDB.
Key Features:
User registration and authentication;
Task management with the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks;
Secure routes to access tasks only for authenticated users.
Hosting:
The server is hosted on Render, allowing the project to run in real time and be accessible online. However, it’s worth mentioning that the site is not yet optimized for mobile devices, but I plan to improve the mobile version soon.
